# pong.js

This project is a Pong game written in JavaScript, designed to run on the Bun runtime.
To create this terminal-based game, I used libraries like Blessed and Terminal-kit for comparison.
Blessed turned out to be the most suitable, and I plan to create more terminal games with it in the future. I hope you enjoy it!

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.24. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
